# Math is fun

This is a small demo I gave for students of my sister. Slides are available here
http://anvaka.github.io/talks/mathisfun

Unfortunately slides have very little value, since I did most of the time show 
code examples.

You can traverse through slides by checking out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/anvaka/mathfun
cd mathfun
```

And then selcting tag:

```
git checkout Slide_1
...
git checkout Slide_10
```
