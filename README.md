# Math is fun

This is a small demo I gave for students of my sister at [uabs.edu.ua](http://uabs.edu.ua/en/).

Slides are available [here](
http://anvaka.github.io/talks/mathisfun). Final demo: [constructing a terrain](http://anvaka.github.io/mathfun/). Slides have very little value, since I did most of the time show code examples.

You can traverse through slides by checking out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/anvaka/mathfun
cd mathfun
```

And then selecting a tag:

```
git checkout Slide_1
...
git checkout Slide_10
```

# For would be students in Ukraine
